# Advent of Code 2023

Python was fun last year but the amount of learning I had to do for each challenge (all FIVE that I managed) was too prohibative a hurdle for me.

I'll definitely go back to Python one year, but this year I want to challenge myself to...actually solve the challenges. So I'm working with JavaScript, my old faithful.

I remember running into problems in 2021 when using JS for Advent of Code and thinking "this would be a lot easier to solve with Python matrices".

Since then, I feel like I have upskilled quite a lot when it comes to processing data and data structures in JavaScript, thanks to the problems I work on at Dayshape. If I run into the same hurdles and have to do, like, matrix multiplication (that's what I hit in 2021 iirc), I'll just find an npm package.

Truly, I just want to actually complete this this year. Here we go...
